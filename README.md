# Arabic Poetry NLP

## Project's Description:

This project aims to Analyse Arabic Poetry using NLP and apply different Mechain learning algorithms for both Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, to help answer the following questions:

- How to classify poems based on labels.
- How to predict labels based on Topic Modeling.

## Dataset:

### Data Dictionary:

| Column Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Poem | Piece of writing in which the expression of feelings and ideas is given intensity by particular attention to diction (sometimes involving rhyme), rhythm, and imagery |
| Number of Versu | How many line in the poem |
| Poet |  Name of who wrote the poem |
| Century | The way the poem was written  |
| Type | How many line in the poem |
| Metre | The basic rhythmic structure of a poem |

### Data Source:
   - Web Scraping AlDiwan for Arabic Poetry Webstibe: https://www.aldiwan.net/

###  Mechain learning algorithms:
- Supervised Learning: Multi-class Classification.
- Unsupervised Learning: Topic Modeling.

## Conclusion:
- Even though we preform different Mechain learning algorithms we end up with underfitting due the small dataset we had, therefore; as a part of our future work we are planning to expand the dataset and try even more NLP and Mechain learning algorithms to get better results.
